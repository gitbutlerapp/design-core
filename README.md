# Design Tokens

The place where we generate design tokens for the app.
In order to generate the tokens, we use [Cobalt-UI](https://cobalt-ui.pages.dev/guides/getting-started) packages.

## Installation

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

Place your tokens in root of the project in a file called `tokens.json` and run:

```bash
npx co build
```

it will generate a `tokens` folder with the tokens in CSS formats.
